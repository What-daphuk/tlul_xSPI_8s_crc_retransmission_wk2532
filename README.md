# tlul_xSPI_8s_crc_retransmission_wk2532
This Verilog project bridges a TileLink (TL-UL) SoC interface to an xSPI peripheral. It features a complete TL-UL master/slave and an xSPI controller/slave with CRC8 error checking and retransmission. The system translates TL-UL read/write requests into serial xSPI transactions, ideal for interfacing with flash memory or other peripherals.
